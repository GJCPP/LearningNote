- Assuptions
	- Frames share a same length.
	- Time partitioned into equal size slots.
	- Nodes start to transmit only at slot beginning.
	- **Nodes are synchronized.**
	- If 2 or more nodes transmit in slot, all nodes detect collision.
- Protocol
	- When a node has a new frame to send, it sends the frame right away.
	- If no collision, the node sends next frame (if has) in next slot.
	- If collided, in each following slot, the node has a probability of $p$ to resend that frame.
- Efficiency
	- $\lim_{n\to +\infty} np^*(1-p^*)^{n-1}=1/e=0.37$
	- where $p^*$ is the optimal
