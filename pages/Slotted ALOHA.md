- Assuptions
	- Frames share a same length.
	- Time partitioned into equal size slots.
	- Nodes start to transmit only at slot beginning.
	- **Nodes are synchronized.**
	- If 2 or more nodes transmit in slot, all nodes detect collision.
- Protocol
	- When a node has a new frame to send, it sends the frame right away.
	- If no collision, the node sends next frame (if has) in next slot.
	- If colli
