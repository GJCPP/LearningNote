- Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)
- Simple CSMA
	- 1. Listen before send.
	- 2. If channel busy, defer.
	- 3. If channel idle, send it.
- CSMA/CD
	- CD: Collision detection
	- collisions detected within short time
	- colliding transmissions aborted, reducing channel wastage
	- collision detection easy in wired, difficult with wireless
		- Because the node must be able to "hear" when "talk", which is difficult in wireless setting.
