- Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)
- Simple CSMA
	- 1. Listen before send.
	- 2. If channel busy, defer.
	- 3. If channel idle, send it.
- CSMA/CD
	- CD: Collision detection
	- collisions detected within short time
	- colliding transmissions aborted, reducing channel wastage
	- collision detection easy in wired, difficult with wireless
		- Because the node must be able to "hear" when "talk", which is difficult in wireless setting.
	- Ethernet CSMA/CD algorithm
		- 1. NIC receives datagram from network layer, creates new frame.
		- 2. If NIC senses the channel
			- idle: send right away
			- busy: wait until it goes idle
		- 3. If without collision: done.
		- 4. If collision detected: abort, send jam signal.
		- 5. After abort, NIC enters binary back-off
			- After $m$th abort, NIC chooses $K \gets \{0, 1, ..., 2^m-1\}$ randomly
			- It then waits for $K\cdot 512$ bit times, and goes to step 2.
		- Efficiency
			- $\frac{1}{1+5t_{prop}/t_{tran}}$
			- $t_{prop}$: propagation delay.
			- $t_{tran}$: time to transmit max-size frame.

	- **Each frame must be long enough to detect any collision**
