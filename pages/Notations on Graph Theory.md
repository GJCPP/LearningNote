	- **Arborescence** : rooted tree in directed graph
		- In graph theory, an **arborescence** is a directed graph in which, for a vertex $u$ (called the root) and any other vertex $v$, there is exactly one directed path from $u$ to $v$.
		- From [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arborescence_(graph_theory))
	- **Nontrivial graph**
		- which means to have at least two vertices
	- **Endvertex**
		- the vertex of degree $1$ is called endvertex
		- in tree, it means exactly "leaf"
	- **Order**
		- The order of a graph $G$ is the number of its vertices.
		- Denoted by $|G|$.
	- **Size**
		- The size of a graph $G$ is the number of its edges.
		- Denoted by $e(G)$.
	- **Factor**
	  id:: 63de02cd-f2a1-431a-a98d-fd2ebb25ea2e
		- A factor of a $G$ is a spanning subgraph.
		- If the factor is $r$-regular, it's an $r$-factor.
