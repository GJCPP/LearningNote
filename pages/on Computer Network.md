	- access network
		- the network that physically connects an end system to the first router ("edge router") on a path from the end system to any other "distant" end system
		- The word "distant" is very vague, which suggests that this notation is more a conceptual one rather than a technical one.
	- link transmission rate
		- a.k.a. link bandwidth / link capacity
	- guided media / unguided media
	- switching
		- packet-switching
			- store and forward: each packet must fully arrive at the router before it is forwarded
		- circuit-switching
			- Multiplexing (FDM / TDM)
				- Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
				  collapsed:: true
					- Each call allocated a narrowed band

		- IXP (Internet Exchange Point)
			- If two region ISPs are physically close, they might (after negotiation) build a IXP instead of flowing through tier-1 ISP.
		- regional ISP may connect access networks to tier-1 ISPs (Zhejiang Telecom -> China Telecom)
		- content provider networks: private network that connects its data centers to Internet, often bypassing tier-1, regional ISPs.
	- Network delay
		- $d = d_{proc} + d_{queue} + d_{tran} + d_{prop}$
		  collapsed:: true
			- processing delay + queuing delay + transmission delay + propagation delay
			- $d_{tran} = \text{packet length (bits) } / \text{ link transmission rate (bps)}$
			- $d_{prop} = \text{physical distance (meters) } / \text{ propagation speed (m/s)}$
		- Traffic intensity
			- $\text{arrival rate of bits } / \text{ transmission rate}$
			- close to 1: queuing delay large
	- Throughput
		- rate of which bits are being sent
		- instantaneous throughput / average throughput
		- bottleneck link
		  collapsed:: true
			- link on an end-end path that constrains end-end throughput

	- Five-layer model
		- Application Layer
			- responsible for applications' communications
			- more concerned about semantic thing
			- examples: HTTP, IMAP, STP, DNS
		- Transport Layer
			- responsible for processes' communications
			- examples: TCP, UDP
		- Network Layer
			- responsible for routing, and send message host-to-host
			- the layer where router works
			- examples: IP, routing protocol
		- Link Layer
			- responsible for transmission between a link
			- the layer where switcher works
			- IP unavailable; MAC for addressing
			- examples: Ethernet, 802.11 (Wi-Fi), PPP
		- Physical Layer
			- physically encoding / decoding
- Chapter 2: Application Layer Overview
  collapsed:: true
	- Architecture for application
		- Client-server architecture
			- server
				- an always-on host
				- with fixed IP address (for client to find)
				- usually in datacenter
			- client
				- interact with server
				- connect (and then disconnect) from time to time
				- may have dynamic IP address
				- not connected to other clients directly
			- examples: HTTP, IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol), FTP
		- Peer-to-peer Architecture
			- no always-on server
			- hosts connect to each other directly
			- peer gets service from other peer, and also provides service
	- Process communication
		- client process: the one that initiates the communication
		- identifier: IP address + port number
		- "port" is conceptual: you can NOT find it in hardware
	- What does an application layer protocol define
		- 1. types of messages exchanged
			- e.g. request, response
		- 2. message syntax
			- the structure of a message
		- 3. message semantics
		- 4. rules
	- What transport service may an app need
		- Reliable data transfer
			- e.g. FTP needs 100% accuracy, while some real-time audio apps tolerates loss
		- Timing
			- e.g. telephony, interactive game
		- Throughput
			- e.g. multi-media
		- Security
	- HTTP
		- HTTP response time (per object)
			- 1 RTT for initiate TCP connection
			- 1 RTT for request / transmitting back (i.e. some network delays)
			- Extra time for transmitting objects
			- Round Trip Time (RTT): time for a small packet to travel from client to server and back
		- non-persistent HTTP
			- each TCP connection is closed after one object is transmitted
			- requires 2 RTT per object
		- persistent HTTP
			- TCP connection is maintained until the client has no more object to request for
		- stateless: server do not record the state / requests of clients
		- Cookies
			- If the server is willing to record your browse state, it can assign a unique ID to you (Cookies)
			- The server records your info into database.
			- You can attach Cookies to your request, so the server knows your browse state.
		- HTTP response status code
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675778112825_0.png)
		- Web caches (aka proxy servers)
			- works both as client and server
			- Why web caching
				- reduce responding time
				- reduce network traffic
			- use condition GET: "If modified since ..."
				- get "304 not modified" if not modified
				- otherwise get a a new web page
			- Hit rate: the fraction of requests served by cache
	- E-mail
		- SMTP is used to deliver email from user's agent to mail server, and from mail server to another mail server
		- POP3 / IMAP is used to download email from mail server.
	- Domain name system (DNS)
		- to translate a domain name to its IP address
		- runs in application layer
		- Service
			- alias name
				- beside canonical domain name, a service may have some alias names
			- load balance
				- several IP address correspond to a same domain name
				- thus, requests can be allocated to many server
		- Structure
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675784137544_0.png)
				- There are 13 logical root servers, with many copies.
			- Client first asks root DNS server for .com DNS server
			- Then ask .com DNS server for yahoo.com DNS server
			- Authoritative server can be maintained by organization/service provider, and returns target IP
		- Local DNS server
			- caches some name-to-IP pairs
			- helps local hosts to send request for DNS service
			- do NOT belong to the 3-level hierarchy
			- Iterated query
			  collapsed:: true
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675784672893_0.png)
			- Recursive query
			  collapsed:: true
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675784714085_0.png)
				- Not realistic
				- Can be required by setting flag bit (but usually refused by server in 3-level hierarchy)
		- DNS record
			- distributed database storing resource records (RR)
			- RR format: (name, value, type, ttl)
			- type = A
				- name is hostname
				- value is IP address
			- type = NS
				- name is domain (e.g., foo.com)
				- value is hostname of the authoritative name server for this domain
			- type = CNAME
				- name is a alias name for some canonical names
				- value is its canonical name
			- type = MX
				- name is a mail service's name
				- value is the SMTP mail server associated with that name
	- Client-server vs P2P
		- consider distribute a file of size $F$ in a network
		- client-server
			- $D_{cs} \geq \max \{NF/u_s, F/d_i\}$
			- $NF/u_s$ is the time for the server to transmit all files copies
			- $F/d_i$ is the time for each user to download
			- grow linearly w.r.t $N$
		- P2P
			- $D_{P2P} \geq \max\{F/u_s, F/d_{min}, NF/(u_s + \sum u_i)\}$
			- $F/u_s$ is the time for the source to upload the file
			- $F/d_{min}$ is the time for the slowest peer to download
			- $NF/(u_s + \sum u_i)$ because the file must be uploaded for at least $N$ times
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675850385925_0.png)
	- BitTorrent
		- file divided into 256KB chunks
		- Requesting chunks
			- periodically, a peer asks each peers for list of chunks that they have
			- it requires the missing chunks from other peers, rarest first
		- Sending chunks
			- peer sends chunks to those 4 peers that are current sending at highest speed to it
				- other peers are choked by it: will not receive any chunks from it
			- re-evaluate top-4 peers every 10sec
			- every 30sec, it randomly chooses a peer and sends chunks
				- so new comers would have chunk to send, and then may become some peers' top-4 peer
	- Video streaming and CDNs
		- Coding
			- spatial redundancy: within one image, nearby pixels are close in color to each other
			- temporal redundancy: between one frame and next
			- CBR: constant bit rate
			- VBR: variable bit rate; video encoding depends on the spatial and temporal redundancy
		- Challenges
			- huge number of users
			- the server-to-client bandwidth varies over time
			- packet may loss, or arrive in wrong order
			- client-interactivity: pause, fast-forward, rewind, jump
		- DASH: Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP
			- server:
				- divides video file into multiple chunks
				- each chunk encoded at multiple different rates
				- different rate encodings stored in different files
				- files replicated in various CDN nodes
				- manifest file: provides URLs for different chunks
					- manifest file contains several servers that are close to the client
			- client:
				- periodically estimates server-to-client bandwidth
				- consulting manifest, requests one chunk at a time
				- chooses maximum coding rate sustainable given current bandwidth
				- can choose different coding rates at different points in time (depending on available bandwidth at time), and from different servers
			- client decides
				- when to send a chunk
				- what the encoding rate should be
				- where to request a chunk
			- Streaming video = encoding + DASH + playout buffering
		- CDN: Content Distribution Networks
			- use several servers located at geographically different locations
			- enter deep: push CND server deep *into* many access networks
			- bring home: put a few server close to access network
			- authoritative DNS returns CNAME with another authoritative DNS, who actually is in charge of storing and delivering the content

- Chapter 3: Transport Layer Overview
	- Targets
		- multiplexing, demultiplexing
		- reliable data transfer
		- flow control
		- congestion control
		- provide logical communication between processes
			- applications -> processes -> hosts -> neighbors -> links
	- The "packet" in this layer is called segment (段)
	- Multiplexing, demultiplexing
		- All messages sent/received by all processes are delivered by a same program working at transport layer
		- TCP
			- uses (source IP, source port, target IP, target port) value to direct messages to appropriate process
			- Demultiplexing uses (IP, port number).
		- UDP
			- uses (IP, port) to direct messages
			- Demultiplexing uses port number only.
	- UDP - User Datagram Protocol
		- common in streaming video, DNS, SNMP(Simple Network Management Protocol), HTTP3(QUIC)
		- UDP segment
		  collapsed:: true
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675949892727_0.png)
		- Checksum
			- 1. cut payload into 16-bit integers
			- 2. one by one, add them up
			- 3. when the addition overflows, add the $1$ (that overflows) to the end of the result
			- 4. lastly, flip all bits
			- Examples: (consider a 4-bit version)
				- sum = $0110+1010+1101 = 0001+1101 = 1110$
				- checksum = 0001
			- To check: the receiver adds the sum of payload to the checksum, the result should be zero.
		- Pluses
			- no hand-shaking (which takes a RTT)
			- can function when network service is compromised
			- helps with reliability (checksum)
	- Reliable Data Transfer (RDT)
		- (here are versions of some stupid and naive protocols which dare try to imitate our glorious TCP with contemptible UDP)
		- RDT 1.0
		  collapsed:: true
			- no bit error, no loss of segment
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675950880258_0.png)
		- RDT 2.0
		  collapsed:: true
			- with bit error, no loss of segment
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675957386483_0.png)
			- Sender sends and wait for ACK with correct sequence number.
		- RDT 3.0
		  collapsed:: true
			- with bit error, loss of segment
			- Add "time-out" feature.
		- Pipelining
		  collapsed:: true
			- to allow multiple in-flight, but yet-to-be-acknowledged packets
			- Go-Back-N
			  collapsed:: true
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675957905480_0.png)
				- Sender consecutively transmit unACKed packets.
				- Receiver **discards** packets that arrive out of order, and sends the lastly accepted packet's sequence number.
				- Sender ignore duplicated ACK.
				- When the oldest in-flight packet times-out, sender **resend all packets in the window** (back N)
				- Example
				  collapsed:: true
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675958167680_0.png)
			- Selective Repeat
			  collapsed:: true
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675958192288_0.png)
				- Sender
				  collapsed:: true
					- Sender consecutively transmit unACKed packets.
					- Sender's window is continuous, and moves when its left edge are not blocked.
					- **Each packet a timer: when it times-out, resend only that packet and restart timer.**
				- Receiver
				  collapsed:: true
					- Receiver also has a receiving window.
					- The window moves when the lowest packet inside is obtained (just received or already in buffer).
					- Let receiving window be [recvBase, recvBase+N-1]
					- **For packet in [recvBase-N, recvBase+N-1], receiver shall send ACK.**
					- or packet in [recvBase, recvBase+N-1], receiver shall buffer.
					- Otherwise, it ignores.
				- Examples
				  collapsed:: true
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675959054216_0.png)
					- No retransmission for 3,4,5: they haven't timed-out yet. (NOT because sender has received their ACKs)
			- Minimum sequence number space for two schemes
			  collapsed:: true
				- Assuming that packets always arrive in order. (otherwise the answer will be $\infty$)
				- Go-Back-N: $N+1$
				  collapsed:: true
					- Firstly, $N$ is not safe.
					- Consider $N+1$. The receiver is always expecting exactly one next packet (e.g. $x$): can it be a wrong packet?
					- Note that only if sender receives previous $x-N$ ACK, will it send that expected packet.
					- If sender receives $x-N$ ACK, it sends exactly that correct packet; otherwise it will never (as constrained by window size) be able to send $x$ (when it resends some packets).
					- If it cannot send $x$, since $x-N, ..., x-1$ have arrived, there is no in-flight $x$.
					- Thus, the receiver is always expecting the correct packets, and receiving that correct one.
				- Selective Repeat: $2N$
				  collapsed:: true
					- Consider the worst case.
					- The sender sends $1, ..., N$, and receiver receives them all.
					- Yet the receiver's ACKs are all lost, somehow.
					- In this condition, the sending window and receiving window are at largest distance.
					- The receiver is expecting $N+1, ..., 2N$ now.
					- The sender decides again to send $1, ..., N$. So we must keep $1$ out of receiving window.
					- Which means that the sequence number must be able to hold $2N$, instead of  wrapping it to $1$.
					- So $2N$ be.
	- TCP
		- Segment structure
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1676010044841_0.png)
			-
			- Note that both TCP and UDP segment contains NOT IP information, for that they will be encapsulated into IP datagram which contains IP.
			- Sequence number here is number of next first **byte**. Remember that RDT uses the number of packet.
			- ACK number is the **next expected seq number**
			- (I have to say the RDT things simply makes all concepts a mass)
		- Time-out
			- (about how to set time-out value)
			- SampledRTT: measured time from sending the segment to receiving its ACK. (ignore retransmission)
			- EstimatedRTT = $(1-\alpha)$ EstimatedRTT + $\alpha$ SampledRTT
				- Typically $\alpha = 0.125$
			- DevRTT = $(1-\beta)$ DevRTT  + $\beta$|SampleRTT-EstimatedRTT|
				- EWMA (Exponentially weighted moving average)
				- EWMA of SampledRTT deviation from EstimatedRTT
				- Typically $\beta = 0.25$
			- TimeoutInterval = EstimatedRTT + $4*$DevRtt
			- (Some stupid formulas that are probably just experiential)
		- Fast retransmit
			- On receiving three additional ACK seq number: retransmit the packet containing that byte immediately.
			- That is, "receiving the same ACK for four times" in total.
			- Examples
			  collapsed:: true
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1676011755340_0.png)
		- Retransmit behavior
			- TCP uses Go-Back-No or Selective Repeat
			- It depends on the two sides of the connection.
			- If Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) is enabled/implemented.
		- Examples on sending segments
		  collapsed:: true
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1676011493650_0.png)
			-
		- Flow control
			- The receiver tells the sender current size of free buffer
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1676012244894_0.png){:height 167, :width 188}
			- The sender makes sure the in-flight data never overflows $rwnd$
			- $inflight = LastBytesSent - LastByteAcked$
			- For sender: $LastByteSent - LastByteAcked \leq rwnd$
		- 3-way handshake
			- 1: Client -> Server
			- 2: Server -> Client (Client side established)
			- 3: Client -> Server (Server side established)
			- In the third time, the client can send message directly.
			- So in total it takes exactly $1$ RTT to establish connection.
			- What is establishment: to allocate system resource for the connection.
			- 2-way handshake vs 3-way handshake
			  collapsed:: true
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1676018626291_0.png)
		- 4-way handshave
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1676018993546_0.png){:height 271, :width 469}
			- The client waits for extra time to ensure that the server receives the FIN, so the server can free its resource as soon as possible.
		- Congestion control
			- basically two ways: end-end or network-assisted
			- [[TCP congestion control]]
			- Formula for throughput of TCP Reno
				- TCP throughput = $\frac{1.22\text{MSS}}{\text{RTT}\sqrt{L}}$
				- where $L$ is the rate for packet loss
		- TCP fairness
			- Fairness: if there are $T$ connections over a  link with bandwidth $R$, then each connection should share a bandwidth of $R/T$.
