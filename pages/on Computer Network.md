	- access network
		- the network that physically connects an end system to the first router ("edge router") on a path from the end system to any other "distant" end system
		- The word "distant" is very vague, which suggests that this notation is more a conceptual one rather than a technical one.
	- link transmission rate
		- a.k.a. link bandwidth / link capacity
	- guided media / unguided media
	- switching
		- packet-switching
			- store and forward: each packet must fully arrive at the router before it is forwarded
		- circuit-switching
			- Multiplexing (FDM / TDM)
				- Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
				  collapsed:: true
					- Each call allocated a narrowed band
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675693413774_0.png)
				- Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)
				  collapsed:: true
					- Each call allocated a periodic time slot
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675693427170_0.png)
			- Advantage
				- no loss of packets
				- no queuing delay
				- reliable data transfer

		- IXP (Internet Exchange Point)
			- If two region ISPs are physically close, they might (after negotiation) build a IXP instead of flowing through tier-1 ISP.
		- regional ISP may connect access networks to tier-1 ISPs (Zhejiang Telecom -> China Telecom)
		- content provider networks: private network that connects its data centers to Internet, often bypassing tier-1, regional ISPs.
	- Network delay
		- $d = d_{proc} + d_{queue} + d_{tran} + d_{prop}$
		  collapsed:: true
			- processing delay + queuing delay + transmission delay + propagation delay
			- $d_{tran} = \text{packet length (bits) } / \text{ link transmission rate (bps)}$
			- $d_{prop} = \text{physical distance (meters) } / \text{ propagation speed (m/s)}$
		- Traffic intensity
			- $\text{arrival rate of bits } / \text{ transmission rate}$
			- close to 1: queuing delay large
	- Throughput
		- rate of which bits are being sent
		- instantaneous throughput / average throughput
		- bottleneck link
		  collapsed:: true
			- link on an end-end path that constrains end-end throughput

	- Security
		- Authentication
		- Confidentiality
		- Integrity checks
		- Access restriction
		- Firewalls
	- Five-layer model
		- Application Layer
			- responsible for applications' communications
			- more concerned about semantic thing
			- examples: HTTP, IMAP, STP, DNS
		- Transport Layer
			- responsible for processes' communications
			- examples: TCP, UDP
		- Network Layer
			- responsible for routing, and send message host-to-host
			- the layer where router works
			- examples: IP, routing protocol
		- Link Layer
			- responsible for transmission between a link
			- the layer where switcher works
			- IP unavailable; MAC for addressing
			- examples: Ethernet, 802.11 (Wi-Fi), PPP
		- Physical Layer
			- physically encoding / decoding
- Chapter 2: Application Layer Overview
  collapsed:: true
	- Architecture for application
		- Client-server architecture
			- server
				- an always-on host
				- with fixed IP address (for client to find)
				- usually in datacenter
			- client
				- interact with server
				- connect (and then disconnect) from time to time
				- may have dynamic IP address
				- not connected to other clients directly
			- examples: HTTP, IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol), FTP
		- Peer-to-peer Architecture
			- no always-on server
			- hosts connect to each other directly
			- peer gets service from other peer, and also provides service
	- Process communication
		- client process: the one that initiates the communication
		- identifier: IP address + port number
		- "port" is conceptual: you can NOT find it in hardware
	- What does an application layer protocol define
		- 1. types of messages exchanged
			- e.g. request, response
		- 2. message syntax
			- the structure of a message
		- 3. message semantics
		- 4. rules
	- What transport service may an app need
		- Reliable data transfer
			- e.g. FTP needs 100% accuracy, while some real-time audio apps tolerates loss
		- Timing
			- e.g. telephony, interactive game
		- Throughput
			- e.g. multi-media
		- Security
	- HTTP
		- HTTP response time (per object)
			- 1 RTT for initiate TCP connection
			- 1 RTT for request / transmitting back (i.e. some network delays)
			- Extra time for transmitting objects
			- Round Trip Time (RTT): time for a small packet to travel from client to server and back
		- non-persistent HTTP
			- each TCP connection is closed after one object is transmitted
			- requires 2 RTT per object
		- persistent HTTP
			- TCP connection is maintained until the client has no more object to request for
		- stateless: server do not record the state / requests of clients
		- Cookies
			- If the server is willing to record your browse state, it can assign a unique ID to you (Cookies)
			- The server records your info into database.
			- You can attach Cookies to your request, so the server knows your browse state.
		- HTTP response status code
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675778112825_0.png)
		- Web caches (aka proxy servers)
			- works both as client and server
			- Why web caching
				- reduce responding time
				- reduce network traffic
			- use condition GET: "If modified since ..."
				- get "304 not modified" if not modified
				- otherwise get a a new web page
			- Hit rate: the fraction of requests served by cache
	- E-mail
		- SMTP is used to deliver email from user's agent to mail server, and from mail server to another mail server
		- POP3 / IMAP is used to download email from mail server.
	- Domain name system (DNS)
		- to translate a domain name to its IP address
		- runs in application layer
		- Service
			- alias name
				- beside canonical domain name, a service may have some alias names
			- load balance
				- several IP address correspond to a same domain name
				- thus, requests can be allocated to many server
		- Structure
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675784137544_0.png)
				- There are 13 logical root servers, with many copies.
			- Client first asks root DNS server for .com DNS server
			- Then ask .com DNS server for yahoo.com DNS server
			- Authoritative server can be maintained by organization/service provider, and returns target IP
		- Local DNS server
			- caches some name-to-IP pairs
			- helps local hosts to send request for DNS service
			- do NOT belong to the 3-level hierarchy
			- Iterated query
			  collapsed:: true
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675784672893_0.png)
			- Recursive query
			  collapsed:: true
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675784714085_0.png)
				- Not realistic
				- Can be required by setting flag bit (but usually refused by server in 3-level hierarchy)
		- DNS record
			- distributed database storing resource records (RR)
			- RR format: (name, value, type, ttl)
			- type = A
				- name is hostname
				- value is IP address
			- type = NS
				- name is domain (e.g., foo.com)
				- value is hostname of the authoritative name server for this domain
			- type = CNAME
				- name is a alias name for some canonical names
				- value is its canonical name
			- type = MX
				- name is a mail service's name
				- value is the SMTP mail server associated with that name
	- Client-server vs P2P
		- consider distribute a file of size $F$ in a network
		- client-server
			- $D_{cs} \geq \max \{NF/u_s, F/d_i\}$
			- $NF/u_s$ is the time for the server to transmit all files copies
			- $F/d_i$ is the time for each user to download
			- grow linearly w.r.t $N$
		- P2P
			- $D_{P2P} \geq \max\{F/u_s, F/d_{min}, NF/(u_s + \sum u_i)\}$
			- $F/u_s$ is the time for the source to upload the file
			- $F/d_{min}$ is the time for the slowest peer to download
			- $NF/(u_s + \sum u_i)$ because the file must be uploaded for at least $N$ times
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1675850385925_0.png)
	- BitTorrent
		- file divided into 256KB chunks
		- Requesting chunks
			- periodically, a peer asks each peers for list of chunks that they have
			- it requires the missing chunks from other peers, rarest first
		- Sending chunks
			- peer sends chunks to those 4 peers that are current sending at highest speed to it
				- other peers are choked by it: will not receive any chunks from it
			- re-evaluate top-4 peers every 10sec
			- every 30sec, it randomly chooses a peer and sends chunks
				- so new comers would have chunk to send, and then may become some peers' top-4 peer
	- Video streaming and CDNs
		- Coding
			- spatial redundancy: within one image, nearby pixels are close in color to each other
			- temporal redundancy: between one frame and next
			- CBR: constant bit rate
			- VBR: variable bit rate; video encoding depends on the spatial and temporal redundancy
		- Challenges
			- huge number of users
			- the server-to-client bandwidth varies over time
			- packet may loss, or arrive in wrong order
			- client-interactivity: pause, fast-forward, rewind, jump
		- DASH: Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP
			- server:
				- divides video file into multiple chunks
				- each chunk encoded at multiple different rates
				- different rate encodings stored in different files
				- files replicated in various CDN nodes
				- manifest file: provides URLs for different chunks
					- manifest file contains several servers that are close to the client
			- client:
				- periodically estimates server-to-client bandwidth
				- consulting manifest, requests one chunk at a time
				- chooses maximum coding rate sustainable given current bandwidth
				- can choose different coding rates at different points in time (depending on available bandwidth at time), and from different servers
			- client decides
				- when to send a chunk
				- what the encoding rate should be
				- where to request a chunk
			- Streaming video = encoding + DASH + playout buffering
		- CDN: Content Distribution Networks
			- use several servers located at geographically different locations
			- enter deep: push CND server deep *into* many access networks
			- bring home: put a few server close to access network
			- authoritative DNS returns CNAME with another authoritative DNS, who actually is in charge of storing and delivering the content
