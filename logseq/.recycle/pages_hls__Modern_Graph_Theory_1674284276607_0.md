- Another important device in practical calculations is the so-called star-triangle(or star-delta) transformation. If a vertex v is joined to just three vertices, say a, b, and c, by edges of resistances A, B, and C, then we call v the centre of a star, as in the first picture of Fig. 11.4. If no current is allowed to enter or leave at v, then we are allowed to replace this star by the triangle configuration shown in the second picture of Fig. 11.4, because, as the reader should check (see Exercise 11), if the vertices a, b, c are set at potentials Va, Vb, Ve, then in the two networks we get precisely the same currents Waco, Wbco, Weco leaving the network. Needless to say, we may apply the transformation in reverse, replacing A', B', and C' by A = B' C' / T, B = C' A' / T, and C = A' B' / T, where T = A' + B' + C'.
