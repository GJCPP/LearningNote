- The variant of [[Hall's theorem]] on general graph.
- Theorem
	- Denote $q(G)$ by the number of odd components in $G$.
		- "Odd component" is a component of odd order.
	- Then $G$ has a $1$-factor iff for every $S\subseteq V(G)$
	  collapsed:: true
	  $$q(G-S)\leq |S|$$
		- c.f. ((63de02cd-f2a1-431a-a98d-fd2ebb25ea2e))
- Proof
	- Necessity
		- Suppose a $1$-factor $H$ of $G$.
