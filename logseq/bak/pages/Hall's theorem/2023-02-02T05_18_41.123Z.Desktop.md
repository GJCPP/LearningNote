- Theorem
	- Consider a bipartite graph $G$ with vertex sets $V_1$ and $V_2$.
	- It has a complete matching from $V_1$ to $V_2$ iff
	  $$|\Gamma(S)| \geq |S| \text{ for every } S \subseteq V_1$$

		- For any $G$ satisfying the condition, we could find a minimal subgraph spans it such that it still satisfy the condition.
		- If we remove edge $a_1x$, $|\Gamma(A_1\backslash \{a_1\})| < |A_1\backslash \{a_1\}|$. This is guaranteed by how we choose $A_1$.
		- Same holds for $a_2$.
		- Consider what happens for $A_1\cup A_2$. Adding two edges joining the same vertex could not save it.
- Collary
	- A regular bipartite graph has a complete matching.
		- Which suggests that, for any group $G$ and its subgroup $H$, we can find $g_1, g_2, ..., g_m$ such that:
			- $\bigcup_i g_iH = \bigcup_i Hg_i = G$
	- For bipartite graph $G = G_2(m,n)$
		- If for every $S_1 \subseteq V_1$, $|\Gamma(S)|\geq |S|-d$.
		- Then $G$ contains $m-d$ independent edges.
		- (and vise versa)

	- For bipartite graph $G=G_2(m,n)$
		- Let $h$ be the maximal number of independent edges.
		- Let $i$ be the maximal number of independent vertices.
		- Let $j$ be the minimal number of edges and vertices covering all the vertices.
		- Then $i = j = m+n-h$. Note that here $m+n$ is the number of vertices.

			- First paragraph means $h+(n+m-2h) = j$.
