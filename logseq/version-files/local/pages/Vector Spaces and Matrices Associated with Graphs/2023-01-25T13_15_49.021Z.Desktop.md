- Definitions
	- The `vertex space` $C_0(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the complex vector space of all functions from $V(G)$ into $\mathbb{C}$
	  $$C_0(G) \stackrel{def}{=} \{ f:V(G)\to \mathbb{C} \}$$
	- The `edge space` $C_1(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the complex vector space of all linear functions from $E(G)$ into $\mathbb{C}$
	- `Formal sum`

		- ((63ce22e4-db7e-4f36-b562-87ee80f539b7))
		- The sum $\sum_{i=1}^n x_iv_i$ is a formal sum of the vertices.
		- And $(v_1, ..., v_n)$ is the `standard basis` of the vertex space.
		- $v_i$ could also be seen as a function $V(G)\to \mathbb{C}$ that is $0$ everywhere except at the vertex $v_i$ it is $1$.
		- Same notations applies to $C_1(G)$ and $(e_1, ..., e_m)$.
	- We endow these spaces with inner product in which the standard bases are orthonormal, i.e. $\langle\vec{x}, \vec{y}\rangle=\sum_i x_i\bar{y_i}$
	  collapsed:: true
		- which is standard inner product of complex space, where $\langle \vec{x}, \vec{x}\rangle \geq 0$ for any vector $\vec{x}$.
	- `Cycle space`
		- Let $L = u_1u_2\cdots u_l$ be a cycle in $G$. Say $e_i = u_ju_{j+1}$ is *oriented as* $L$ if $e_i$ is oriented from $u_j$ to $u_{j+1}$.
		- The oriented cycle $L$ of $G$ can then be represented by a vector in $C_1(G)$ shown below.
		  ((63ce33e3-5e63-42a9-94c0-7c1fc6682ef6))
		- Denote by $Z(G)$ the subspace of $C_1(G)$ spanned by the vectors $\vec{z_L}$ as $L$ runs over the set of cycles. $Z(G)$ is the cycle space of $G$.
	- `Cut space` / `Cocycle space`
		- Let $P$ be a partition $V = V_1\cup V_2$
		- The set $E(V_1,V_2)$ denotes the edges in between.
