- Classical result on network flow.
- Theorem
	- The maximal flow value from $s$ to $t$ equals the minimum of the capacities of cuts separating $s$ from $t$.
	- In other words, $\max v(f)=\min c(S, \bar{S})$
- Proof
	- Easy to see that $v(f)\leq c(S,\bar{S})$, so one side of the theorem is trivial.
	- Firstly there is indeed a $f$ with some maximal $v$. (c.f. [here](((63d330ae-be6b-4e7e-8537-6b5be1cd0b58))))
	- The proof constructs a cut with capacity $v$.
		- We construct a cut $(S, \bar{S})$
		  collapsed:: true
			- Let $x\in S$.
			- For any $y$, if one of the following two holds
			  1. $c(x,y)>f(x,y)$ (unsaturated)
			  2. $f(y,x)>0$ (inverse flow)
			- Then also let $y\in S$.
		- $(S, \bar{S})$ is a cut; otherwise we find an augmenting path.
		- $c(S,\bar{S})$ equals $v(f)$ in the obvious way.
- Remark
	- In multi-sources and multi-sinks network, this also holds.
		- which can be proved by adding super souce/sink.
	- By replacing vertex with edge, it can be used to find minimum vertex-cut.
	- In multi-commodity flow problem, this generally doesn't holds.
